# Deep-Learning-Based-Gait-Recognition-Using-Smartphones-in-the-Wild
In this paper, we study gait recognition using smartphones in the wild. Unlike traditional methods that often require the person to walk along a specified road and/or at a normal walking speed, the proposed method collects inertial gait data under a condition of unconstraint without knowing when, where, and how the user walks.
